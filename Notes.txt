JKM spot price benchmark for LNG

only data given for jap, korea, taiwan china

individual model for each coutry, then group together then feed to other downsteam stuff

some data already factored in other data, like the LNG demand is alraedy a reflection of temerature data, so temperature data is not required 



south korea domestic gas demand last entry, data is wrong 

additive model, use decompose() in R


then can use forecast.HoltWinters() and stuff to predict?


If you have a time series that can be described using an additive model with constant level and no seasonality, 
you can use simple exponential smoothing to make short-term forecasts.

Holt’s Exponential Smoothing
If you have a time series that can be described using an additive model with increasing or decreasing trend and no seasonality, 
you can use Holt’s exponential smoothing to make short-term forecasts.
